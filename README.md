# pumat

Python Library that wraps incremental driver models to make it easier to generate simple and complex load cases and facilates the post-processing of the data.

## Goal
The following are the goals for this repo:
1) Make working with incremental driver faster and easier
2) Integrate the analysis of incremntal driver with the soil models developed/being developed by this organization
3) Make it easier to analyze incremental driver results

:warning: This repo is still in development. The interfaces and structure of the code are still subject to change.

## Note

The inspiration and the original framework for this work came from [Luis Zambrano](https://github.com/luisez1988).
